# The Chronicles of the Sundered Realm

## The Breaking

Three hundred years ago, the great kingdom of Aethermoor stood united under a single banner, its crystalline spires reaching toward heavens that still held color. The realm knew peace then, before the Sundering, when magic flowed like rivers through the ley lines that connected every settlement from the Northern Wastes to the Jade Coast.

The Sundering came not as war, but as whisper. Ancient texts speak of a ritual gone wrong in the depths of the Celestial Observatory, where the kingdom's most learned sages attempted to harness the power of a dying star. Instead of capturing its light, they shattered the very fabric that held the realm together. The explosion could be seen from every corner of the kingdom, a pillar of impossible colors that twisted reality itself before collapsing into nothing.

In the aftermath, the world had changed. The ley lines were broken, magic pooled in dangerous concentrations in some places while leaving others barren. The great kingdom fractured, not just politically, but physicallyâ€”entire regions drifted apart, separated by zones of wild magic where reality itself became unreliable.

## The New World

From the ruins of Aethermoor, five distinct factions emerged, each claiming their own territory and developing their own ways of survival.

**The Ironhold Clans** retreated to the mountains, where they built great fortress-cities within the peaks themselves. They are known for their rejection of magic and their embrace of steel and stone. Their society values what can be held, measured, and forged.

**The Verdant Covenant** disappeared into the Deepwood, where the Sundering had caused nature to grow in ways both beautiful and terrible. They speak of harmony and adaptation, of learning to bend rather than break. Few outsiders understand their ways.

**The Ashward Collective** remained in the blast lands closest to the original catastrophe, where ash still falls like grey snow. They built their settlements from salvage and determination, creating something new from the bones of the old world. They are survivors above all else.

**The Ethereal Schism** consists of those most touched by the wild magic of the Sundering. They established sanctuaries in the spaces between territories, in places where reality remains thin. They seek understanding of what was broken and what might be mended.

**The Remnant Assembly** holds the coastal strongholds, claiming to be the true heirs of fallen Aethermoor. They maintain the old ceremonies and hierarchies, though some say they cling to shadows of a dead kingdom. They speak often of bloodlines and proper order.

## The Current tensions

Now, three centuries after the Sundering, the factions maintain an uneasy balance. Trade happens when necessary, though trust remains scarce. Each faction has developed its own culture, its own traditions, its own way of seeing the world. What one faction considers honorable, another might see as foolish. What one values as strength, another might dismiss as weakness.

The neutral zones between territories remain dangerous. Wild magic storms can strike without warning, and creatures twisted by the Sundering hunt in the borderlands. Yet these zones are also where members of different factions sometimes meet, where the rigid boundaries blur, where unexpected alliances form.

Each faction tells different stories about the Sundering. Some say it was punishment for hubris. Others claim it was sabotage. A few whisper it was necessary, though they never say why. The truth, if anyone knows it, remains unspoken.

## The Whispered Prophecy

Recently, strange dreams have plagued citizens across all five factions. The dreams are never quite the same, but they share common elements: a sound like breaking glass, shadows that move against the light, and a voice speaking words in a language that predates the kingdom itself.

Some dismiss these as echoes of trauma, the collective memory of a wounded world. Others see them as warnings. The faction leaders watch each other with renewed suspicion, wondering if someone attempts to recreate the mistakes of the past.

In markets and taverns, around campfires and in throne rooms, speculation runs wild. Some speak of reunification, of setting aside old grievances to face whatever comes. Others argue the factions are stronger apart, that unity was what allowed the Sundering to happen in the first place.

## The Uncertain Future

The world stands at a crossroads, though few realize it yet. Small choices ripple outward in unexpected ways. A merchant who extends trust across faction lines. A scholar who shares forbidden knowledge. A warrior who chooses mercy over vengeance. A child born between two worlds, belonging fully to neither.

History will remember some names and forget others. Some will rise to greatness, others will fade into obscurity. But in this moment, before the dice are cast and the stories are written, all possibilities remain open.

The Sundered Realm waits, holding its breath, for whatever comes next.
